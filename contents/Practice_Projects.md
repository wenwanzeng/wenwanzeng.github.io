### Practice Projects

---

#### Host–Guest Multiscale Simulation

Performed multiscale simulations of host–guest systems by combining molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics. Constructed full molecular systems, conducted classical MD for sampling, and applied quantum calculations to the binding region for detailed interaction analysis.

---

#### Coarse-Grained Simulation of Peptides in Water

Built coarse-grained models of peptides in aqueous environments using the Martini force field. Simulated folding behavior, aggregation, and solvent interactions. Analyzed structural stability and conformational ensembles over extended timescales.
