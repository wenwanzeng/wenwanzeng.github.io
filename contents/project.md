#### 1. Toward a comprehensive understanding of excitation-dependent luminescence in triplet-triplet annihilation
**Abstract**: Triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) is widely used in optical up-conversion and exciton-based devices due to its high energy efficiency.However, traditional kinetic models fail to capture the complex dynamics observed in many one-component organic TTA systems.This work proposes a generalized TTA kinetic model by incorporating additional excited states under different conditions and deriving a new formalism for luminescence intensity.The model provides a more universal criterion for identifying TTA behavior and offers a practical tool for analyzing systems with non-traditional kinetics.

**Method**: Kinetic modeling of triplet-triplet annihilation process, supported steady-state spectrum experiments and TDDFT simulations.  
**Results**: \
a. Two models, eleven cases

b. General formalism： 

$$
I_{\text{em}} = N(Ck_{\text{ex}} + Ak_{\text{ex}} + B - \sqrt{B^2 + 2ABk_{\text{ex}}})
$$
$$
\Phi_{\text{em}} = N(C + A + B/k_{\text{ex}} - \sqrt{(B/k_{\text{ex}})^2 + 2AB/k_{\text{ex}}})
$$

c.Experimental fitting formula:

$$
\Phi_{\text{em}} = c + a*(1+(1-\sqrt{1+4*d*I_{\text{ex}}})/2*d*I_{\text{ex}})
$$
