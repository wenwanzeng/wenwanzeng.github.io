#### Hostâ€“Guest Multiscale Simulation

By combining molecular dynamics with quantum mechanics, a multi-scale simulation of the host-guest system was conducted. The stable structure of the single molecule was obtained through DFT calculations; classical molecular dynamics simulations were carried out; different clusters were selected for ONIOM calculations based on the classical molecular dynamics simulations; and the charge transfer relationship between the host and the guest was analyzed based on the calculation results.

#### Coarse-Grained Simulation of Peptides in Water

Built coarse-grained models of peptides in aqueous environments using the Martini force field. Simulated folding behavior, aggregation, and solvent interactions. Analyzed structural stability and conformational ensembles over extended timescales.
